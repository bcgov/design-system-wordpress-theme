# DSWP Default Heading

## Overview
This pattern provides a standardized heading block with carefully defined spacing that aligns with the WordPress Design System. The heading block features a style variation that lets you choose between two appearances: the **BC Government's visual style (1)** or the **default WordPress style (2)**. For consistency and proper design integration, it is recommended to use this pattern instead of the default WordPress Heading block.
 
::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
