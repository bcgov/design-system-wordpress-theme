# DSWP Default Heading

## Overview
This pattern provides a standardized heading block with consistent spacing and styling to work with the Design System.  It is recommended to use the pattern instead of the default WordPress Heading block.
 
::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.

## Style Variations
