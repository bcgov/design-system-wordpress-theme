# DSWP Horizontal Card
## Overview
This pattern creates a responsive horizontal card layout with an image and content side by side. It features a box shadow hover effect, making it ideal for interactive content sections like featured items, services, or blog post previews.
::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
