# DSWP Card with Hyperlink List

This card-based layout pattern is ideal for presenting multiple related items, such as services, features, or categories, in an organized grid format. It provides users with clear navigation options through linked lists while maintaining visual consistency across your WordPress site.

> **Important**: Each pattern consists of several blocks. It's crucial to only adjust the content and color block settings, as the structural settings like padding and margins are designed to ensure the pattern remains responsive. Altering the structural block settings may cause the pattern to function improperly.

Each Design System Pattern enables you to customize the content and styles of individual blocks. For instance, here's how you can change the separator color on a card.
