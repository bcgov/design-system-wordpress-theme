# DSWP Vertical Cards

## Overview
This pattern creates a responsive grid of vertical cards, each containing an image, heading, description, and a linked call-to-action. It's ideal for showcasing services, features, or content categories in a visually consistent format.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
