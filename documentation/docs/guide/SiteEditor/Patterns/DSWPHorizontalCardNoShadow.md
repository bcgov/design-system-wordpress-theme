# DSWP Horizontal Card No Shadow

## Overview
This pattern creates a horizontal layout with content on the left and an image on the right, without box shadow effects. It's designed for clean, minimal presentations featuring a heading, subheading, and a list of links alongside an image.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
