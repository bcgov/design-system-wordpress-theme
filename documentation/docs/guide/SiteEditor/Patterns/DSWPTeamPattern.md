# DSWP Team Pattern

## Overview
This pattern creates a series of team member profiles, alternating between white and light gray backgrounds. Each profile features a circular image, name, subtitle, and detailed biography in a two-column layout.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
