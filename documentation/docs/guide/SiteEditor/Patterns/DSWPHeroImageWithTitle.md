# DSWP Hero Image With Title
## Overview
This pattern creates a hero section with a background image and an overlaid content box. It's designed to create impactful page headers that combine visual imagery with text content while maintaining accessibility and readability.
::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
