# DSWP Horizontal Card Large Image - Right

## Overview
This pattern creates a full-width horizontal layout with content on the left and a large image on the right. It features a reverse layout from the left-image variant, making it ideal for alternating content sections on a page.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
