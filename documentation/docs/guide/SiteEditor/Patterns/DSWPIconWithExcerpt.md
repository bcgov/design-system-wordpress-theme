# DSWP Icon with Excerpt

## Overview
This pattern creates a two-column layout featuring icon-heading combinations with accompanying text excerpts. It's ideal for presenting features, services, or key points in a visually balanced format.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
