# DSWP Information Contact Socials

## Overview
This pattern creates a bordered container with a header and a grid of contact/social information cards. Each card features an icon, heading, description, and link. It's ideal for contact pages, footer sections, or any area requiring organized contact information.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
