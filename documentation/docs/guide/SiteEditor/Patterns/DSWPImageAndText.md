# DSWP Image & Text

## Overview
This pattern creates an asymmetrical layout with an image on the left and text on the right. It's designed for content sections that need visual balance while maintaining readability.

::: warning Important Note
Each pattern consists of several blocks. Only adjust the content and color block settings. The structural settings (padding and margins) are pre-configured for responsiveness. Modifying structural settings may break the pattern.
